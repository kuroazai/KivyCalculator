# KivyCalculator
Creating a calculator application in Python using Kivy.


Version 1 Notes : 

Tried using exec() to process strings for the equations given to the calculator whilst it works it comes with its own security flaws. Made the inputs Readonly to prevent certain types of errors that the user can produce.

Am aware of various issues the application still has, that will be improved upon in the upcoming version that will use a far better system.
